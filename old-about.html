	    I am currently a computer science and biochemistry (minor) student at the
	    University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. <br/>
	    I am interested in building biologically inspired machines that can
	    empower humanity to solve it biggest challenges. <br/>
	    I also enjoy reading history and non-fiction books, collecting textbooks, cycling,
        sprinting, bouldering and <a href="https://thecachemiss.wordpress.com">blogging</a>.

      <h3> Research Interests </h3>
      <p>
        I am interested in building computing systems that can help engineers
        and doctors engineer artificial organisms. Currently, this manifests
        in using computers to predict how protein folds and writing software
        to emulate and predict biochemical processes.

	    Interned on the Street View team.
	    Worked with a team on an internal tools to animate SV data using
	    FFMPEG. Deployed the tool on a HTTP server written in C++ so that
	    the Street View team can evaluating the usefulness of different
    	features.

	    <b> Seshat (drawing board, on pause) </b>
	  </p>
      <p>
        Distributed logging service that allows software programmers to manage
        the state of their microservices. <br/>

	     <b> TMAlign (on pause) </b>
      </p>
	  <p>
        Binary to align and calculate the structural similarity between two
        proteins. I contribute features like allowing the binary to align entire
        directories of proteins. Originally created by the Zhang lab where I also
        write.

	     <b> Condit (on pause) </b>
      </p>
	  <p>
	    A status tracking object for C++ binaries. It is a type that
        provides more useful infromation when programs fail. You can think
        of this as an alternative to returning a bool or a void. <br/>
