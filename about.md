Hi, my name is Samiur.

I am currently a computer science student at the University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor. I am interested in systems programming (kernel, drivers, networking
level). I am also interested in exploring the area between computing and
biochemistry.

I stream my programming efforts. Follow me/subscribe! 
[Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/samiurkhan) and the
[archive](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIp_mwikFpGM4LsEyKSfI1w/featured?view_as=subscriber).

I also enjoy reading history and non-fiction books and thinking about
business/startups/finance. I enjoy weightlifting and cycling.
