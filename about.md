Hi, my name is Samiur.

</div>

I am currently a computer science student at the University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor. I am interested in systems programming (kernel, drivers, networking
level). I am also interested in exploring the area between computing and
biochemistry.

I also enjoy reading history and non-fiction books and thinking about
business/startups/finance. I enjoy weightlifting and cycling.

I work on [Prana](https://getprana.io) too.
