I am currently a computer science and biochemistry (minor) student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am interested in building biologically inspired machines that can empower humanity to solve it biggest challenges. I also enjoy reading history and non-fiction books, collecting textbooks, cycling, sprinting, bouldering.
