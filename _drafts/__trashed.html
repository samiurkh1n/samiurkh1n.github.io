<p><em>TIDK (short for “Things I Didn’t Know”) is a series of blog posts about concepts I found difficult to understand. In each article, I take a concept and explain it in a way that allows you to reason about it intuitively. If you find it too complicated, shoot me an email specifying what part is complicated and I’ll make edits. </em></p>
<hr />
<p>I grew up thinking math was computation (starting at 5 adding shit like 1+1 =2).</p>
<p>Math remains pretty computational up to even college for engineers and people who just need the requirment out of the way. but math is so much more.</p>
<p>Math was our way of explaining the world. its the language of empire. [ancient history of math and using it for counting]</p>
<p>Math has grown a lot since, but here are some snippets</p>
<p>math studies counting (number theory)</p>
<p>math studies structures (like linear algebra and how it can describe nature/3d space)</p>
<p>math studies spaces (shapes and how they interact like dna and topology)</p>
<p>math studies change (calculus used in physics all the time) [tie it back to introduction].</p>
<p>Of course each of these can intersect (linear algebra has a geometric perspective)</p>
<p>Math gives us a means of rationalizing and understanding the world so that we can make our lives a little bit less hectic and understand the world we live in in a language agnostic to the world.</p>
<p>Don't see studying math as something you need to do. Interpret it as giving you a language and a lens that will help you gain a different insight into the problems you might solve some day.</p>
