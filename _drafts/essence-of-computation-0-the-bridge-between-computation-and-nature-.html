<p>Through unknown and rather lucky genetic mutations, our species was given the gift of complex thought. Despite being relatively slow and weak compared to other animals, our ability to communicate and generate complex ideas allowed us to control (and destroy) nature. Our ability placed us at the top of the food chain. We used fire to clear forests; we constructed weapons to hunt animals; we used fictions, like racism and sexism, to justify killing and controlling our own kind.</p>
<p>Today, a large part of our intellectual capacity is dedicated to understanding the universe and everything within it. Through years of experimenting, we have developed theories about how the world exists. Through developing theories, we have developed a language for understanding and predicting the world.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful subsets of that language is mathematics. Mathematics gives us a language for reasoning not just what exists before us at a given moment in time but also what lies ahead. For instance, we could describe an object falling qualitatively. However, mathematics gives humans a precise language for communicating how it falls, like how long it takes, how far it will go. This language gives us a means of predicting the world and, thus, bringing it within the grasps of what we understand and that, undeniably, saves lives. Using mathematics, we can determine or approximate whether a building or bridge can remain standing under environmental forces. Galileo Galilei, the 15th century astronomer, famous for defending that the Sun was the center of the solar system, wrote that mathematics was the language of science.</p>
<p>Mathematics also gave birth to an explosively impactful discipline: computation, a language for describing problems themselves and how best to solve them. In the 1950s, in an attempt to prove or disprove whether a single mathematical foundation can exist, mathematicians like Alan Turing and Alonzo Church created the concept of abstract machines that can help mathematicians reason about the limits of problems or whether a problem was solvable at all. During the later 1950s and on, as the computing needs of society kept growing, these mathematicians became computer scientists and helped build the first electronic computers to handle the computational needs of society. Electronic computers became more complex, more powerful, holding more memory and computing results at a faster rate. Today, computers exist nearly everywhere: our phones are some of the strongest computers in history; corporations run computers the size of multiple football fields that can communicate in real time around the entire planet.</p>
<p>Now, for the sake of argument, let's assume that Galileo was correct in that mathematics was the language of science and thus the language of nature, the object of study for science. Since computation is a subset of mathematics, what is the relation between computation and nature?</p>
<p>While mathematics is the language of nature, computation is the subset that studies how nature encodes information and how nature behaves given these encodings.</p>
<p>One of the clearest example of this is in DNA. DNA can come in all shapes (circle, loops, etc.) and sizes (10,000 base pairs to a few million) but the principle between most DNA is the same and is known as the central dogma of life: DNA is transcribed into many different kinds of RNA, which is then translated into proteins. Through billions of years of random testing, the optimal setup for encoding hereditary information in most environments in the biosphere turns out to be this central dogma. The instructions for how to compose a living being is encoded as DNA. These instructions are universally worked on with organic compounds.</p>
