      <h3> Research Interests </h3>
      <p>
        I am interested in building computing systems that can help engineers
        and doctors engineer artificial organisms. Currently, this manifests
        in using computers to predict how protein folds and writing software
        to emulate and predict biochemical processes.

      <h3> Professional Experience </h3>
      <p>
	    <b> Research intern at the University of Michigan Department of
        Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics</b> <br/>
        Working on software to make protein database search and alignment
        faster.
      </p>
      <p>
	    <b> TA for EECS 398: Computing for Computer Science </b> <br/>
	    Class teaches students how to learn about tools commonly used by computer
	    scientists like shell scripting, git, linux, IDEs/editors, build
	    systems, package managers, debuggers, VFS, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
	    <b> Engineering Practicum Intern at Google </b> <br/>
	    Interned on the Street View team.
	    Worked with a team on an internal tools to animate SV data using
	    FFMPEG. Deployed the tool on a HTTP server written in C++ so that
	    the Street View team can evaluating the usefulness of different
    	features.

	     <b> Condit </b>
      </p>
	  <p>
	    A status tracking object for C++ binaries. It is a type that
        provides more useful infromation when programs fail. You can think
        of this as an alternative to returning a bool or a void. <br/>
