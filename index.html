      <h3> Research Interests </h3>
      <p>
	I am interested in writing biologocally-inspired algorithms and 
	machines. Currently, I am interested in combining reinforcement 
	learning and evolutionary strategies to give agents the ability to
	plan and try unexplored alternatives. I am also interested in the
	mathematics and computation around DNA strands and curves.

      <h3> Professional Experience </h3>
      <p>
	<b> TA for EECS 398: Computing for Computer Science </b> <br/>
	How to learn how to discover and use tools commonly used by computer
	scientists like shell scripting, git, linux, IDEs/editors, build
	systems, package managers, debuggers, VFS, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
	<b> Engineering Practicum Intern at Google </b> <br/>
	Interned on the Street View team.
	Worked with a team on an internal tools to animate SV data using
	FFMPEG. Deployed the tool on a HTTP server written in C++ so that
	the Street View team can evaluating the usefulness of different
	features.

	     <b> Condit </b>
      </p>
	  <p>
	    A status tracking object for C++ binaries. It is a type that
        provides more useful infromation when programs fail. You can think
        of this as an alternative to returning a bool or a void. <br/>
