In this post, I wanted to explore computing as a science, not just an engineering
discipline. There is an interesting bridge between computing and nature that, I
believe, is worth taking a look at (or maybe spending an entire lifetime exploring).

### The capacity for language.

Through unknown and rather lucky genetic mutations, our species was given the gift of
complex thought. Despite being relatively slow and weak compared to other animals, our
ability to communicate and generate complex ideas allowed us to control (and destroy) 
nature. Our ability placed us at the top of the food chain. We used fire to clear fore
sts; we constructed weapons to hunt animals; we used fictions to help coordinate
large groups of people, either to do good or to do bad.

A large part of our intellectual capacity is dedicated to understanding the universe
and everything within it. Through years of experimenting (science!), we have developed
theories about how the world is. Through developing theories, we have developed a
language for understanding and predicting the world.

### Mathematics as the language of nature.

One of the most powerful subsets of that language is mathematics. Mathematics gives us
a language for reasoning not just what exists before us at a given moment in time but 
also what lies ahead. For instance, we could describe an object falling qualitatively.
However, mathematics gives humans a precise language for communicating how it falls, 
like how long it takes, how far it will go. This language gives us a means of
predicting the world and, thus, bringing it within the grasps of what we understand 
and that, undeniably, saves lives. Using mathematics, we can determine or approximate 
whether a building or bridge can remain standing under environmental forces. Galileo
Galilei, the 15th century astronomer, famous for defending that the Sun was the
center of the solar system, wrote that mathematics was the language of science. 
Since science is a collection of theories about nature, it's safe to conclude that
mathematics is the language of nature.

### The birth of computing

Mathematics also gave birth to an explosively impactful discipline: computation, a
language for describing problems themselves and how best to solve them. In the 1950s,
in an attempt to prove or disprove whether a single mathematical foundation can exist,
mathematicians like Alan Turing and Alonzo Church created the concept of abstract
machines that can help mathematicians reason about the limits of problems or whether a
problem was solvable at all. During the later 1950s and on, as the computing needs of 
society kept growing, these mathematicians became computer scientists and helped build
the first electronic computers to handle the computational needs of society.
Electronic computers became more complex, more powerful, holding more memory and
computing results at a faster rate. Today, computers exist nearly everywhere: our
phones are some of the strongest computers in history; corporations run computers the 
size of multiple football fields that can communicate in real time around the entire
planet.

### Computing as a means to understand nature ... and us.

While mathematics is the language of nature, computation is the subset that studies
how nature encodes information and how nature behaves given these encodings.

One of the clearest example of this is in DNA. DNA can come in all shapes (circle,
loops, etc.) and sizes (10,000 base pairs to a few billion) but the principle between
most DNA is the same. Most if not all living beings use DNA as a template for other
biomolecules, like RNA and proteins. Through billions of years of random testing, the
optimal setup for encoding hereditary information in most environments in the
biosphere turns out to be this central dogma (of DNA to RNA to protein).
The instructions for how to compose a living being is encoded as DNA. It's not hard
to imagine DNA as a form of *templated* source code which gets "compiled" into
programs (proteins and other biomolecules) that do computations (chemical reactions
in the body).

Another example of this is our brain. The question around building intelligent
machines is as nearly old as computing itself. In recent years, there has been an
explosion in machine learning and neural networks as the most promising form of
artificial intelligence. Neural networks, a concept created in the 1970s, was inspired
by the neurons and their connections! Here, nature has encoded intelligence into
the connections of the brain.

(note to biologists and neuroscientists: sorry if I was inaccurate, feel free to
correct me and I will change the descriptions above).

### To save a life.

If we explore how nature encodes and uses information, it's possible that we can
further our understanding of us: how we think, generate new thoughts, how we came to
be from a physical or chemical point of view. Hopefully, with this new information,
one day we can use computing to save a life. Until then, we shall see.
