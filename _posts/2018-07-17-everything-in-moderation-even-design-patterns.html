<p>When novelists or playwrights write a story, they almost never begin by writing<br />
random thoughts down. Most stories tend to follow the same pattern. There tends<br />
to be a beginning, which introduces the setting, the characters and their<br />
relationships, etc. Then the middle, where there are some sequence of conflicts<br />
or challenges that the characters face that build up to some climax. Stories<br />
then end with some conclusion or resolution.</p>
<p>Similarly, some would say that a similar pattern exists for writing software in<br />
the form of design patterns. Object oriented programming introduced the idea<br />
of programming a set of interacting objects. Design patterns are, in a sense,<br />
common patterns of interacting objects. However, while literature has a pattern<br />
for writing stories that is pretty reliable and uncomfortable for readers once<br />
broken, programming doesn't seem to reap the same benefits with design patterns.</p>
<p>There are obviously cases where some design patterns make sense. One such<br />
pattern is the factory method. The biggest reason I enjoy using a factory to<br />
construct objects is that you can short circuit the creation of the object if<br />
the parameters are off. Without a factory method, you could use some variable<br />
that holds the state of the construction. For instance, something like this:</p>
<pre>class SomeClass {
  public:
    SomeClass(string parameter) {
      if (parameter.empty()) {
        construction_state_ = false;
      }
    }
    ~SomeClass() = default;
    // ... other code here ...
  private:
    // false = bad, true = good to go.
    bool construction_state_;
};</pre>
<p>but if your class holds a lot of data at construction, there's a large amount<br />
of compute power you end up wasting because of it. Now with the factory method,<br />
once you know the parameter is empty, you can stop the creation all together:</p>
<pre>class SomeClass {
  public:
    ~SomeClass() = default;

    static StatusOr&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;SomeClass&gt;&gt; Create(string parameter) {
      if (parameter.empty()) {
        return ::util::InvalidArgument("Parameter is empty");
      }
      return std::make_unique&lt;SomeClass&gt;(parameter);
    }
  private:
    explicit SomeClass(string parameter) : parameter_(parameter) {}
    string parameter_;
};</pre>
<p>with a main binary that looks like this:</p>
<pre>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  StatusOr&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;SomeClass&gt;&gt; instance = SomeClass::Create(argument);
  // ... do things with "instance" ...
}</pre>
<p>If something was wrong with the argument passed, SomeClass would never get<br />
created in the first place.</p>
<p>(I'm about to evangelize Condit. You've been warned). Because I used Condit, I<br />
can use the status of the computation that was returned and take a different<br />
course of action (what to do if the object wasn't created). You could do that<br />
with the first example too but code readibility plummets as a result.</p>
<p>However, there are some design patterns that are somewhat horrible to use too.<br />
One such example is the polymorphic cousin of the factory, the abstract factory.<br />
I entertained the thought of using an abstract factory when I needed to create<br />
the fake version of an API that I was writing. The reason an abstract factory<br />
pattern applies here is because I was trying to use a single abstract<br />
interface to try and create a family of related concrete objects (one concrete<br />
object was the actual implementation that would be used in production and the<br />
other being the fake that would be used for testing). From the time I first<br />
started writing code for it to about 2 hours later, I ended up having to add<br />
five classes, with minute differences between each:</p>
<pre>class AbstractFactory {}
class ConcreteFactoryOne {}
class AbstractAPI {}
class ConcreteAPI {}
class Client {}</pre>
<p>Notice that I haven't even gotten to the fake API yet. I was trying my best to<br />
keep my code simple but the abstract factory wasn't helping. I ended up<br />
scrapping this, making the one method in the concrete API that I needed to fake<br />
virtual, and reimplementing it in a fake instead of using an abstract factory<br />
pattern. The code ended up smaller, more concise and organized. A win for today.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that the abstract factory pattern or other rather large<br />
design patterns aren't useful. My goal for this article was to give a more<br />
cautionary tale on why unquestioning adherence to the design pattern and<br />
object oriented programming philosophy isn't the best course of action. In any<br />
engineering organization, time is one of your most valuable assets. When you<br />
don't need to do work in one area, you free up time to do work where it matters.<br />
So don't spend time implementing a design pattern just for the sake of having<br />
a common language with other programmers or just for the sake of having design<br />
patterns. Many programmers don't speak with design patterns anyway (for good<br />
reason). What matters most (or should matter most) is serving customers needs<br />
and writing scalable, efficient, maintainable code that delivers on those needs.</p>
<p>A note: I am, by no means, an expert in design patterns. If you have a suggestion on how I could've tackled the issue above more effectively with design patterns, I'm all ears (and I'll follow up this article with a correction).</p>
