<p>When novelists or playwrights write a story, they almost never begin by writing
random thoughts down. Most stories tend to follow the same pattern. There tends
to be a beginning, which introduces the setting, the characters and their
relationships, etc. Then the middle, where there are some sequence of conflicts
or challenges that the characters face that build up to some climax. Stories
then end with some conclusion or resolution.</p>
<p>Similarly, some would say that a similar pattern exists for writing software in
the form of design patterns. Object oriented programming introduced the idea
of programming a set of interacting objects. Design patterns are, in a sense,
common patterns of interacting objects. However, while literature has a pattern
for writing stories that is pretty reliable and uncomfortable for readers once
broken, programming doesn't seem to reap the same benefits with design patterns.</p>
<p>There are obviously cases where some design patterns make sense. One such
pattern is the factory method. The biggest reason I enjoy using a factory to
construct objects is that you can short circuit the creation of the object if
the parameters are off. Without a factory method, you could use some variable
that holds the state of the construction. For instance, something like this:</p>
<pre>class SomeClass {
  public:
    SomeClass(string parameter) {
      if (parameter.empty()) {
        construction_state_ = false;
      }
    }
    ~SomeClass() = default;
    // ... other code here ...
  private:
    // false = bad, true = good to go.
    bool construction_state_;
};</pre>
<p>but if your class holds a lot of data at construction, there's a large amount
of compute power you end up wasting because of it. Now with the factory method,
once you know the parameter is empty, you can stop the creation all together:</p>
<pre>class SomeClass {
  public:
    ~SomeClass() = default;

    static StatusOr&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;SomeClass&gt;&gt; Create(string parameter) {
      if (parameter.empty()) {
        return ::util::InvalidArgument("Parameter is empty");
      }
      return std::make_unique&lt;SomeClass&gt;(parameter);
    }
  private:
    explicit SomeClass(string parameter) : parameter_(parameter) {}
    string parameter_;
};</pre>
<p>with a main binary that looks like this:</p>
<pre>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  StatusOr&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;SomeClass&gt;&gt; instance = SomeClass::Create(argument);
  // ... do things with "instance" ...
}</pre>
<p>If something was wrong with the argument passed, SomeClass would never get
created in the first place.</p>
<p>(I'm about to evangelize Condit. You've been warned). Because I used Condit, I
can use the status of the computation that was returned and take a different
course of action (what to do if the object wasn't created). You could do that
with the first example too but code readibility plummets as a result.</p>
<p>However, there are some design patterns that are somewhat horrible to use too.
One such example is the polymorphic cousin of the factory, the abstract factory.
I entertained the thought of using an abstract factory when I needed to create
the fake version of an API that I was writing. The reason an abstract factory
pattern applies here is because I was trying to use a single abstract
interface to try and create a family of related concrete objects (one concrete
object was the actual implementation that would be used in production and the
other being the fake that would be used for testing). From the time I first
started writing code for it to about 2 hours later, I ended up having to add
five classes, with minute differences between each:</p>
<pre>class AbstractFactory {}
class ConcreteFactoryOne {}
class AbstractAPI {}
class ConcreteAPI {}
class Client {}</pre>
<p>Notice that I haven't even gotten to the fake API yet. I was trying my best to
keep my code simple but the abstract factory wasn't helping. I ended up
scrapping this, making the one method in the concrete API that I needed to fake
virtual, and reimplementing it in a fake instead of using an abstract factory
pattern. The code ended up smaller, more concise and organized. A win for today.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that the abstract factory pattern or other rather large
design patterns aren't useful. My goal for this article was to give a more
cautionary tale on why unquestioning adherence to the design pattern and
object oriented programming philosophy isn't the best course of action. In any
engineering organization, time is one of your most valuable assets. When you
don't need to do work in one area, you free up time to do work where it matters.
So don't spend time implementing a design pattern just for the sake of having
a common language with other programmers or just for the sake of having design
patterns. Many programmers don't speak with design patterns anyway (for good
reason). What matters most (or should matter most) is serving customers needs
and writing scalable, efficient, maintainable code that delivers on those needs.</p>
<p>A note: I am, by no means, an expert in design patterns. If you have a suggestion on how I could've tackled the issue above more effectively with design patterns, I'm all ears (and I'll follow up this article with a correction).</p>
