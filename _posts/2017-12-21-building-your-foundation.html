<blockquote>“You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">- Marcus Aurelius, <em>Meditations</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"Who are you?"</em> It's a question we hear all the time. Depending on the environment, it's also most likely a question we have pre-scripted responses to. At work, one might respond with their position. Another person might have been raised a part of a proud family with a strong heritage and so, they respond that they are a member of that family. Someone else might respond with their wealth. If you ask yourself that question, you might answer simply with your name. Unfortunately, some may ask themselves this question and answer "I am a failure."</p>
<p>I was certainly in that first group for some time. Through high school, I was a completely work-centered person. My identity was deeply tied to my work (in the classes I took, in the clubs I was in, in my grades). When I graduated high school, however, that all went away and I was left with <em>a void</em>. I would ask myself "Who am I?" and not know how to respond. My work was complete and I didn't know what to do. I had nothing to rally around. I didn't know what I stood for. I needed to find an answer to this question. I sought a sustainable meaning and purpose.</p>
<p>This year's end, I encourage you to find the answer to who you are in the way that I did that saved me: <strong>identify your core values and principles</strong>. By doing this, you begin the process of building a foundation for yourself that can never be taken away from you.</p>
<p>Life, chance, evil, and other uncontrollable forces will throw all the stones it has at you. Work and jobs are always temporary. Families can split. Loved ones can pass away. Wealth can disappear. Some of these challenges will cause you to trip; some of these challenges will cause you to collapse.</p>
<p>However, no matter what gets thrown at you, your identity, grounded in a set of values, will always be with you. When you base yourself in your values, you have a pool of mental energy to draw from that no one can take. When you ground yourself in your values, you have a clear means of self-improvement. If you imagine your values as the constitution that governs your actions, you can make amendments to your values to improve yourself. When you define yourself in terms of these values and principles, you give yourself a new, sustainable sense of self-worth that isn't tied to external forces that you can't control.</p>
<p>I encourage you to begin the year by building your foundation (your constitution). Let your purpose and values be the source of your strength as you tackle the challenges of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays y'all.</p>
